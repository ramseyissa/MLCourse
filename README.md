# CS6350
This is a machine learning library developed by Ramsey Issa for CS5350/6350 in
University of Utah. 

Requirements.txt file added and can be used to install env to properly run algorithms. 

Algorithms Are found in Decision Tree, Ensmeble Learning, and LinRegression folders. 
For Decision Tree simply use the run.sh file and the decision tree will run to
completion for HW1.

To run the the Ensemble learning algorithms (AdaBoost, Bagged Trees, and Random Forest)
simply run the run.sh file and this will run all 3 algorithms.

For linear regression, simply run the run.sh file and it will excute all segements for
the linear regression problem. 

If run.sh fails, individual _HW2.py files can be run in each folder.
